subtitle: Why I'm at least slightly better than OK
---

My name is Neal Whitlock. I'm transitioning careers into Data Science from Mathematics Education. 

I taught for six years in two very different high-need high schools; the second one being in one of the most beautiful areas of the country. 

A couple of things about me:

- I usually have a killer beard. Sometimes I get rid of it but it keeps coming back.
- I enjoy spending time outdoors doing things ranging from sitting on a bench in the shade, walking (along the road or up a mountain), and biking.
- I also enjoy spending time not outdoors doing things like playing games (video and board), watching TV with my family, and sleeping.

I have two amazing kids that can be the highlight of my day. Especially when they say ridiculous things like the following:


Son: Can I have more treat?
Me: I've already given you an answer.
Daughter: It means it's no.


Son: The Paw Patrol's got Baby Jesus!


Potty Training Video: Wash your hands for 20 seconds.
Son: For 20 seconds!?!?
Me: Yep, you're supposed to.
Son: Not in our world.


(The first snowstorm of the season.)
Daughter: Daddy, it's wintering out there!
